Created repo. Up to this point, the home area was created, as was the about and services sections. The modal for services was just finished. Aiming to have navbar appear at about section then should be able to proceed with rest of site.

Lots of updates!
Navbar Overlay background lightened, whitesmoke color applied to text.
Contact section completed (all correct information input, php form added *tested).
Map added.
Removed padding from .container-fluid and left/right margins from .row.
Adjusted navbar-toggler margin to keep it off the edges and added background color.
Added hover to buttons (same as when clicked).
Added top/bottom padding to entire sections (not testimonial) instead of the rows within.
Added if/else statement to smooth scroll script. Now, if screen is bigger then specified, when a nav is clicked, it will come up a few pixels above the clicked section. If the screen is smaller (mobile), now the scroll will go straight to the section. Without this, there would be empty space above the section.
Added footer, added href for email address.
Added href for company email and phone number.
Added notification to home section indicating tax season hours.
